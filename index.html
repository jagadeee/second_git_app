    <pre>Almost at the half-way mark of the tournament and teams would not take anything but a win! RCB have been handed their third loss. They were undone a little today by the conditions as well. But that's how it is in a long tournament, it would even out. Punjab have picked up their 5th win and have 10 points from 7 games. Delhi and Punjab look almost certain to make it to the next round. Or are there more twists? RCB have been a little brittle at home. The conditions have mostly back fired for them</pre>
